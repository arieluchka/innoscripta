Notes to take into accounts:
1) some bug reports might be more suitable as a suggestion (instead of a bug). As i see it, if there is an inconsistent behavior, it is bug (even if a very insignificant one) #TODO=link to an example of a bug report
2) for "Product Search and Filtering" it's hard to write accuracy/logical test cases, as it is very depended on the Product requirements.
