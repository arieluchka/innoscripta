Critical Bugs:
1) The OTP code on password resets can be easily bruteforced to hack into existing accounts.

Notes to take into accounts:
1) some bug reports might be more suitable as a suggestion (instead of a bug). As i see it, if there is an inconsistent behavior, it is bug (even if a very insignificant one) #TODO=link to an example of a bug report
2) for "Product Search and Filtering" it's hard to write accuracy/logical test cases, as it is very depended on the Product requirements. 

3) compatibility can tested by parameterizing tests and executing every test on required browsers/different screen sizes/viewports.





## In retrospect
- I should have gone for more broad test cases (user flows), to cover a higher percentage of the website (even if it means less attention to details)
- Should have spend less time on bug documenting (there were so many!)
- Should have invested more time into finding how to utulize AI to be more efficient in writing + organizing the test cases/scripts (probably hard to achieve if there is no history/prior knowledge on the website)

## Todos
1) Categorize tests into groups and priorities (Smoke/Sanity/Regression)

## AI

- Used ai to quickly generate a Proof-Of-Concept for the brute-force security bug.
